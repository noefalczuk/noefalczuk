# About

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in applied machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analysis. My work sits at the intersection of research and real-world applications, with a particular interest in understanding complex systems through data.

I enjoy working on problems that require both theoretical grounding and practical implementation, especially in interdisciplinary settings where data science supports decision-making and scientific discovery.

# Current Focus

I am currently working as a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Researcher at the University of Buenos Aires, where I focus on the characterization of water resources under climate change scenarios using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

My current work includes:

Adapting and calibrating hydrological models (SIMPLE-G) to the Argentine context
Integrating large-scale climatic, agricultural, and economic datasets
Applying machine learning methods to environmental and climate-related problems

# Past Projects

Some of my previous and ongoing projects include:

## Computer Vision for Yeast Detection and Classification
Designed and implemented an end-to-end computer vision system to automatically detect and classify yeasts in microscopic images. Trained and evaluated CNN-based image classification models, optimizing accuracy and robustness.
This project resulted in a functional prototype developed in collaboration with CONICET researchers and microbrew.ar, and was presented at multiple academic conferences.

## Data Analysis for Decision Support
Worked as a Data Analyst at Universidad de San Andrés, performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and SQL-based querying to generate reports and visualizations aimed at supporting institutional decision-making.

## Academic Research in Machine Learning and Applied Statistics
Conducted research in optimal transport, measure quantization, and machine learning, with a focus on both theoretical foundations and practical applications.
My undergraduate thesis, “Measure Quantization for Machine Learning”, provides a theoretical study of quantizers, including proofs of their structural properties and their relationship with Wasserstein barycenters.
The work also explores applications of measure quantization in image processing and federated learning, and was presented through poster contributions at national and international conferences.

## Polynomial Graph Class Recognition Algorithm
Developed the theoretical foundations of a graph class defined by a set of forbidden patterns, and designed a polynomial-time recognition algorithm based on this characterization.
The work involved formal graph-theoretic analysis, identification of minimal obstructions, and the translation of structural properties into an efficient algorithmic procedure for class membership testing.

# Background

I hold a BSc in Data Science from the University of Buenos Aires, graduating with a GPA of 9.70/10. My academic training is complemented by intensive courses and schools in deep learning, computer vision, large language models, and complex systems.

I am fluent in Spanish (native), proficient in English (C1), and have intermediate proficiency in French (B2).
