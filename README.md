# About

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in applied machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analysis. My work sits at the intersection of research and real-world applications, with a particular interest in understanding complex systems through data.

I enjoy working on problems that require both theoretical grounding and practical implementation, especially in interdisciplinary settings where data science supports decision-making and scientific discovery.

# Current Focus

I am currently working as a **Data Scientist / Machine Learning Researcher** at the **University of Buenos Aires**. I am part of the **Group of Intelligent Systems (SI)** (https://gsi.dc.uba.ar/)

My work focuses on applying statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to real-world problems, particularly in interdisciplinary research settings.

# Past Projects

Some of my previous and ongoing projects include:

### Computer Vision for Yeast Detection and Classification
- Designed and implemented an end-to-end computer vision system for automatic yeast detection and classification in microscopic images
- Trained and evaluated CNN-based image classification models, optimizing accuracy and robustness
- Developed a functional prototype in collaboration with CONICET researchers and microbrew.ar
- Presented results at multiple academic conferences
  
### Data Analysis for Decision Support
- Worked as a Data Analyst at Universidad de San Andrés
- Performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and SQL-based querying
- Generated reports and visualizations to support institutional decision-making

### Machine Learning & Applied Statistics Research
https://github.com/noefalczuk/Cuantizacion-de-Medida-para-Aprendizaje-Automatico
- Research in optimal transport, measure quantization, and machine learning
- Undergraduate thesis: *Measure Quantization for Machine Learning*
  - Theoretical study of quantizers and their structural properties
  - Connections with Wasserstein barycenters
