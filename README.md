About

I am a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Researcher with a strong academic background and hands-on experience in applied machine learning, statistical modeling, and data analysis. My work sits at the intersection of research and real-world applications, with a particular interest in understanding complex systems through data.

I enjoy working on problems that require both theoretical grounding and practical implementation, especially in interdisciplinary settings where data science supports decision-making and scientific discovery.

Current Focus

I am currently working as a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Researcher at the University of Buenos Aires, where I focus on the characterization of water resources under climate change scenarios using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques.

My current work includes:

Adapting and calibrating hydrological models (SIMPLE-G) to the Argentine context

Integrating large-scale climatic, agricultural, and economic datasets

Applying machine learning methods to environmental and climate-related problems

Communicating results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

In parallel, I am involved in teaching programming courses as a teaching assistant and continue deepening my knowledge in modern machine learning and deep learning methods.

Past Projects

Some of my previous and ongoing projects include:

Computer Vision for Yeast Detection and Classification
Designed and implemented an end-to-end computer vision system to automatically detect and classify yeasts in microscopic images. Trained and evaluated CNN-based image classification models, optimizing accuracy and robustness.
This project resulted in a functional prototype developed in collaboration with CONICET researchers and microbrew.ar, and was presented at multiple academic conferences.

Data Analysis for Decision Support
Worked as a Data Analyst at Universidad de San Andrés, performing data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and SQL-based querying to generate reports and visualizations aimed at supporting institutional decision-making.

Academic Research in Machine Learning and Applied Statistics
Contributed to research projects involving optimal transport, measure quantization, and machine learning methods, including poster presentations at national and international conferences.
